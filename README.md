### This short guide will brief instruct you about Easy Gun workings.

### 1 - Connecting to the server

In Mac, you'll use **Terminal** to login:

ssh [root@yourIP](mailto:root@yourIP)

To save a remote connection (so that you don't have to type in the command every time):

1.  Select Shell then New Remote Connection... from the top menu
2.  Under the Server column, click on the + icon to add a new connection.
3.  Enter the hostname when prompted by the dialog.
4.  Enter your username (root) in the User field and click Connect_._

For manipulating files, Fetch is a good alternative. Its available freely at http://webstore.illinois.edu/

1.  Double-click on the Fetch dog icon in your Applications folder.
2.  The connection dialog box opens. Fill in the **Hostname:**, **Username:**, and **Password:** boxes with the name of the machine you're connecting to, your login ID on that machine, and your password on that machine.  
    In the figure, example1 is logging into tigger.uic.edu and her NetID is example1.  
    The **Password:** is her ACCC common password.  
    Select **SFTP** from the dropdown list, and click **Connect**.

3.  If this is a connection that you will want to use again, click the heart icon at the end of the Hostname: line before you click Connect, and click Make Shortcut in the small dialog box that opens. This opens another dialog box where you enter the name for the shortcut. The default name for the shortcut will be the host name. If you also click Make this the default shortcut, it will be opened by default for you when you open Fetch. Click OK to create the shortcut. The shortcuts are listed in Fetch's other screen, Fetch Shortcuts, which is at the top left of your desktop, where you can delete or edit them. You can use them from the heart dialog box.  

4.  Then example's home directory on tigger will be displayed in Fetch's screen:

5.  You can highlight a file and click Get to download it, or click Put to open up a Mac file dialog box to select a file to upload. But it's easier to double-click on the name of a directory that you want to open, double-click the name of a file that you want download, and drag and drop a file from your Mac to the Fetch screen to upload it or vice versa  
    .
6.  To change a file on the server's permissions or to delete it, Control-click on its name, and select Get Info or Delete item respectively. To change the permissions, click in the type of permissions you want to give and click Apply.
